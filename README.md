Thao Nguyen's Data Science Journey ✨

Greetings! 

I'm Thao Nguyen, a passionate data science enthusiast on a journey to transform raw information into meaningful insights. As a candidate pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Pace University (Class of 2024), my mission is to fuse the power of numbers with a deep interest in advertising technology.

The Story So Far...

🚀 Professional Odyssey

At The Trade Desk, I played with data using SQL and made it do cool stuff for digital ads. GitLab and Databricks were my buddies for automating data refreshes. Before that, at PriceSpider, I made sure data was accurate and ready to roll.

Back at MTKT Capital Inc., I dug into client data, figuring out who's ready for loans and making sure all the paperwork was top-notch.

🎓 Academic Odyssey

Armed with a Bachelor's in Business Analytics from California State University, Fullerton, I laid the foundation for my analytical prowess. Now, as a Data Science Maestro-in-Training at Pace University, I'm honing my skills in Machine Learning and other tools that transform data into gold.

🌟 Extracurricular Orbits

I'm not just about data; I'm about community. As a member of the Data Science Club at Pace University and the VP of Correspondence for the Business Data Analysis Club, I've orchestrated events, workshops, and competitions, fostering an environment where learning transcends boundaries.

🌐 Projects & Courses

I've worked on exciting projects for both academic assignments and personal learning experiences. This GitHub repository is my digital space to store all of it and create a profile that I can revisit whenever needed. It's also a glimpse into who I am professionally, technically, and perhaps a bit personally for anyone curious!

:sparkling_heart: Let's get personal

I love hiking, painting, dancing, singing, playing sports, watching sports and ... doing nothing.
I can be the life of the party and I can also be a homebody for weeks.
People say I'm funny! - I think so too.
